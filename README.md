## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repository and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Then, load data from seed into the database:

```
$ rails db:seed
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server: <br />
When you used seed, example user info : email: "example@example.com", password: "foobar"

```
$ rails server
```
