<h1 align="center">Welcome to Moim ðŸ‘‹</h1>

"Moim" is a Korean word meaning "gathering".<br />
It is a social application to build an online friendship.<br />
The background image has green coloured grass, and it feels like friends sit down on the grass gathering in the relaxed afternoon.<br />

This is part of the Final Project in [The Odin Projectâ€™s Ruby on Rails Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project).

This app was scheduled building with E-R diagram, user interface workflow design.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repository and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

```
$ rails test
